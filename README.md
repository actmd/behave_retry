behave_retry
============


[http://github.com/actmd/behave_retry](http://github.com/actmd/behave_retry)


Wrapper for python behave to repeat failed scenario tests.

If your python behave scenarios don't always pass (e.g. you use selenium), you can use this behave wrapper to automatically retry the failed scenario X times more. Right now X is set to 2.

Usage: ./behave_retry
